Data science involves a variety of tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data. Common tools include programming languages like Python and R, which offer powerful libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning. Visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Tableau help present data in a clear and impactful way. Techniques in data science range from data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning. Additionally, methods such as feature engineering, model evaluation, and cross-validation are essential for building robust predictive models. Together, these tools and techniques enable data scientists to turn raw data into actionable knowledge.
